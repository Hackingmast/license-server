## Original User Request:
i want to create a windows operable program that can help me to study i will provide documents with questions in it the program should ask me a question and its options i have to choose 1 option from it if i answered wrong the program should teach me what is the answer and why is the answer correct. i will provide the explanation of the right answer after the answer and you could do some changes in the program to show it.  i want you to make a login page on the start of the program where it asks from the user for its roll no, name, and cnic. after that it should ask the user to set a timer and question limit. and the program should pick random questions everytime the user starts the test and when the user enters correct answer it should show a smiley emoji and for wrong answer it should shou sad emoji.while the timer is running play tick sound on every second. when the time limit and question limit is asked ask the user for how many percentage should the program consider to pass the test for example if i pass 95% of the questions and the passing limi is 96% the user should be considered fail when the timer ends show how many questions are wrong which questions are wrong for 30 minutes show the wrong question again and agin for 30 minutes so that the user can review all the wrong questions and prepare them .
